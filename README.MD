2023 Advent of Code Challenge
===================================================

 Created by Eric Wastl, the [2003 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about) is a collection of small programing puzzles, avaiable in any language. As part of the challenge, and come in a variety of difficulties.

 Test cases used to check code are located in Day*_Trebuchet_Test.py files.

 Hints can be found on the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/)

# Problem List

- __Day01_Trebuchet:__ Calibration number values have been incorrectly stored for targeting the trebuchet. On each line, the calibration value can be found by combining the first digit and the last digit (in that order) of the characters to form a single two-digit number. 

Consider your entire calibration document. What is the sum of all of the calibration values?

- __Day02_NumericalWords:__ A further error was found in the calibration document. Some of the values were written in words rather than numbers. Update the code as to correctly calculate the sum of all of the calibration values.
