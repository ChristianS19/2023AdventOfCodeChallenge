2023 Advent of Code Challenge
===================================================

 Created by Eric Wastl, [the 2003 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about) is a collection of small programing puzzles, avaiable in any language. As part of the challenge, and come in a variety of difficulties.

 Test cases used to check code are located in Day*_Trebuchet.py files.

 Hints can be found on the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/)

# Problem List

- __Day01_Trebuchet:__ Calibration numbvaluesers have been incorrectly stored for targeting the trebuchet. On each line, the calibration value can be found by combining the first digit and the last digit (in that order) of the characters to form a single two-digit number. For example:
<p align="center">
1abc2
pqr3stu8vwx
a1b2c3d4e5f
treb7uchet
</p>
In this example, the calibration values of these four lines are 12, 38, 15, and 77. Adding these together produces 142

Consider your entire calibration document. What is the sum of all of the calibration values?
